Check out my SQL avocado project, where I took a data set about avocado sales and I explored, cleaned and wrangled the data to answer questions for the business. 
This data set was sourced from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/avocado-augmented?resource=download

The relevant variables in this data set are:
          Date - The date of the observation
          AveragePrice - the average price of a single avocado
          type - conventional or organic
          year - the year
          Region - the city or region of the observation
          Total Volume - Total number of avocados sold
          4046 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4046 sold
          4225 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4225 sold
          4770 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4770 sold


As part of the cleaning process the following were done:
    1. the first colomn was called "unnamed: 0" and had irrelevant data so it was deleted
    2. "year" was being presented as decimals so it was converted to an integer (2018.12489 --> 2018) 
    3. there were no missing values in the data set

The questions that were answered are: 

Q1: what is the average price of avocados over the entire dataset? 
Q2: What is the total volume of avocados sold for each year? & Which year had the highest total volume of avocados sold?
Q3: What is the average price difference between conventional and organic avocados?
Q4 : Which region had the highest average price for avocados in a specific year?
Q4a : Regions with the highest average price for avocados in 2018 and after
Q4b : Regions with the highest average price for avocados in 2017
Q5: What is the average price per avocado for each PLU code (4046, 4225, 4770)?
Q6: What is the percentage distribution of each avocado type (conventional or organic) over the entire dataset?
Q7: What is the overall trend in avocado prices over the years?
Q8: let's see the percentage decrease in price by year
